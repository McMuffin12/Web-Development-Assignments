    The thing I find the most interesting about Web Develpment is the 
    ability to build such a acessable piece of sofware that can be viewed on almost any device in the world.
    I also find reactive ui elements to interesting as I enjoy the logic side of programming and seeing the 
    way data flows and is displayed on a webpage is cool (Dashboards are kinda my thing). I care alot about user 
    usability because if something isn't worth using then why make it.
