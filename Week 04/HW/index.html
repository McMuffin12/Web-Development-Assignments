    <p class="Note">
      The thing I find the most interesting about Web Development is the
      ability to build such an accessible piece of software that can be viewed on almost any device in the world.
      I also find reactive UI elements interesting as I enjoy the logic side of programming and seeing the
      way data flows and is displayed on a webpage is cool. I care a lot about usability because if something isn't
      worth using then why make it.

      I'm learning JavaScript, exploring web frameworks, and studying website optimization.
      I enjoy building small dashboards and experimenting with UI interactions.
